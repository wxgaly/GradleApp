 *
 * Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the list of banned words. 
 * It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn't banned, and that the answer is unique.
 *
 * Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation. 
 * Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive.  The answer is in lowercase.
 *
 *  
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 * paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
 * banned = ["hit"]
 * Output: "ball"
 * Explanation:
 * "hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
 * "ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph.
 * Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
 * that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"),
 * and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
 *  
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000.
 * 0 <= banned.length <= 100.
 * 1 <= banned[i].length <= 10.
 * The answer is unique, and written in lowercase (even if its occurrences in paragraph may have uppercase symbols,
 * and even if it is a proper noun.)
 * paragraph only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols !?',;.
 * There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.
 * Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.

 *
 * We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.
 *
 * Each turn, we choose the two heaviest rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y. 
 * The result of this smash is:
 *
 * If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
 * If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
 * At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)
 *
 *  
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
 * we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
 * we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
 * we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
 *  
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 1 <= stones.length <= 30
 * 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

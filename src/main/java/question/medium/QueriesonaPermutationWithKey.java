 * Given the array queries of positive integers between 1 and m,
 * you have to process all queries[i] (from i=0 to i=queries.length-1) according to the following rules:
 * <p>
 * In the beginning, you have the permutation P=[1,2,3,...,m].
 * For the current i, find the position of queries[i] in the permutation P (indexing from 0) and then move this at the beginning of the permutation P.
 *  Notice that the position of queries[i] in P is the result for queries[i].
 * Return an array containing the result for the given queries.
 * <p>
 *  
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: queries = [3,1,2,1], m = 5
 * Output: [2,1,2,1]
 * Explanation: The queries are processed as follow:
 * For i=0: queries[i]=3, P=[1,2,3,4,5], position of 3 in P is 2, then we move 3 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[3,1,2,4,5].
 * For i=1: queries[i]=1, P=[3,1,2,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,3,2,4,5].
 * For i=2: queries[i]=2, P=[1,3,2,4,5], position of 2 in P is 2, then we move 2 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[2,1,3,4,5].
 * For i=3: queries[i]=1, P=[2,1,3,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,2,3,4,5].
 * Therefore, the array containing the result is [2,1,2,1].
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: queries = [4,1,2,2], m = 4
 * Output: [3,1,2,0]
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: queries = [7,5,5,8,3], m = 8
 * Output: [6,5,0,7,5]
 *  
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= m <= 10^3
 * 1 <= queries.length <= m
 * 1 <= queries[i] <= m

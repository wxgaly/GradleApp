 *
 * According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life,
 * is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
 *
 * Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0).
 * Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
 * using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
 *
 * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
 * Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
 * Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
 * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 * Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state.?
 * The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state,
 * where?births and deaths occur simultaneously.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 * [
 * ? [0,1,0],
 * ? [0,0,1],
 * ? [1,1,1],
 * ? [0,0,0]
 * ]
 * Output:
 * [
 * ? [0,0,0],
 * ? [1,0,1],
 * ? [0,1,1],
 * ? [0,1,0]
 * ]
 * Follow up:
 *
 * Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time:
 * You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
 * In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite,
 * which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array.
 * How would you address these problems?
